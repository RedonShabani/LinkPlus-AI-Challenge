# AI Challenge - Text Classification

This repository contains my solution for the AI Challenge.  
The task was to build a text classification model that predicts categories from input text.  

## Contents
`AI-Challenge.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all steps (data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optional Flask API).
`model.pkl` & `vectorizer.pkl`: Saved model and vectorizer (for inference, generated after training).
`requirements.txt`: Python dependencies to run the notebook and API.

## Dataset
The dataset includes news articles (2015â€“2017) labeled as `sports` or `business`.  
Due to size, it is not uploaded directly here. You can download it from Kaggle:
